Provisioning Credentials
========================

This guide is intended for those with the responsibility to give users access to
our team's resources.

---
SSH
---

The easiest way to create a SSH keypair is through the nebula interface. :code:`Access
& Security > Key Pairs > Create Key Pair` will bring up the prompt for creation.
Enter the name of the recipient and you should be presented with a private key.
Save the private key and send it to the recipient.

-------------
Network Share
-------------

In order to create credentials for the network share, you will need to SSH into
the network share VM. Once inside, gain root privileges via :code:`sudo su`. In order
to see who currently has an account run:

.. code::

   $ pdbedit -L
     pchrist:1002:
     yifang:1006:
     admin:1001:
     renato:1007:
     akito:1009:
     shiming:1010:


In order to create a user, we must first create a system user and then a samba
user. Create the system user like such:

.. code::

   $ useradd john

Now we can create the samba user like such

.. code::

   $ smbpasswd -a john

You will be prompted for a password twice. Pick a good one and you should be
good to go. Test the credentials yourself to make sure they work and then give
them to the user.

--------------------
RStudio Server Login
--------------------

Since we don't currently have a dedicated authentication server, we need to
manually make sure that the username/password combination is consistent across
machines requiring it. We want users to be able to login to the network share as
well as RStudioServer with the same credentials. There are a few things we need
to make sure this all works correctly.

First, make sure the user has an account on the network share. The guide for
that is just above. In order to keep everything synchronized, we need to look at
their credentials on the network share VM. Go ahead an login to that machine and
execute the following command to view those with an account

.. code::

   $ pdbedit -L
     pchrist:1002:
     yifang:1006:
     admin:1001:
     renato:1007:
     akito:1009:
     shiming:1010:

The **number** following the name is very important. Let's create the user on
the RStudioServer VM. Go ahead and login to the server and execute the folowing
command:

.. code::

   $ useradd -m john
   $ cat /etc/passwd

     john:x:2010:2010::/home/john:

You will many users output, but you're only concerned with the one you just
created. Notice: :code:`2010:2010`. This represents the `uid` and `gid` for the
user. These need to be consistent with the number on the network share machine.
You can modify them on the RStudioServer machine with the following commands:

.. code::

   $ usermod -u 2001 -g 2001 john

The numbers and name of the user should obviously be substituted appropriately.

Give the user a password with the following command

.. code::

   $ passwd john

You will be prompted twice for a password.

Let's create a directory for the network share to be mounted in:

.. code::

   $ mkdir /home/john/share

In order to the get the network share mounted in their home directories, we need
to edit the :code:`/etc/fstab` file. Add an entry like such:

.. code::

   # John
   //192.168.100.33/share /home/john/share cifs credentials=/home/admin/credentials/john.credentials,sec=ntlm 0 0

This puts the share in the user's home directory with the appropriate
permissions. You will need to create the credentials file like such:

.. code::

   username=john
   password=<password here>

All credentials should be put into place. Run the following command to get the
share finally mounted.

.. code::

   $ mount -a

Check to make sure you can login to RStudioServer in the browser and that the
share is mounted properly.
