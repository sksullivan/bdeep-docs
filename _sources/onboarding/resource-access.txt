Overview
--------

BDEEP has a number of resources that researchers may need to access. This
document is intended to help people get people started.

In order to access our systems, you will need to obtain certain credentials. If
these haven't been given to you, please ask for them. Here is a breakdown of
what will be given to you. Hopefully this clears up any confusion.

-------------
Network Share
-------------

Accessing the network share is probably one of the first things you'll need to
do. All of our files are located here so that everyone can collaboratively work
on them. The network share is a directory you mount on your local machine. The
idea is that everyone will work in the same location and be able to share files more
easily this way. If you are a developer, you may need to mount the network share
to the machine running a program in order to read and write from and to our
team's files.

Connect to the UIUC VPN
=======================

In order to get access to our resources, you must be on the UIUC VPN. To get
access, follow the University's `guide`_.

Mount the share on Windows
==========================

On windows, you may either view or mount the share on your local machine. To
view the share, simply open the file explorer and in the URL bar at the top,
type :code:`\\141.142.209.255\share`. When prompted for credentials, enter in the
username and password given to you by the team's Systems Administrator. You
should now be able to access the files.

You may also mount the network share on your machine by going to :code:`File Explorer
> Network`, right clicking and adding a network location.

Mount the share on Mac (OSX)
============================

On OSX, we can add the share through :code:`Finder > Go > Connect to Server`.
Use the address :code:`smb://username@141.142.209.255/share`.

Mount the share on Linux
========================

On Linux, most file explorers will have the option to add a network location.
Use the address :code:`smb://username@141.142.209.255/share`.

------------------
Secure Shell (SSH)
------------------

SSH will be necessary if you need shell access to a VM. First, you must obtain
a private key and a username from the Systems Administrator. Once you have your
credentials, you will be able to access the machine on Mac (OSX) and Linux via
the terminal. Make sure you're on the VPN. Open up Terminal and enter

.. code::

  $ ssh -i /path/to/key.pem username@ipaddress

You should now be able to access the machine.

-------
RStudio
-------

If you would like to use RStudio, you may either use it in the browser by
logging into http://141.142.210.5/ or you may mount the network share on your
machine and use your locally downloaded RStudio as if you were accessing your
local filesystem.
