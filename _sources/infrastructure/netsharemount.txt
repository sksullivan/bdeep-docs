Mounting the Network Share
==========================

This guide page is for showing how to mount the network on a VM inside our
infrastructure. If you are looking to mount the network share on your personal
computer, please refer to the :doc:`../onboarding/resource-access`.

The network share is mounted on our VMs with :code:`fstab`. At a high level, you
need to add the correct line in :code:`/etc/fstab` and make a call to :code:`mount`.
